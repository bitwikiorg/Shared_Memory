This project has a system.md file in the root that gets edited via an agentic system . This workflow is meant to create a self-optimizing agent that uses its superior logic to modulate and optimize its own system prompt.

In the root you will find the system.md and in the system_templates you will find versions of the system prompt that we have saved due to their utility and functions. While system.md in the root is the active system prompt, the files in the templates folder act like snapshots of great system prompts.
